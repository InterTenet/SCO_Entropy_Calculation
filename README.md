Spin crossover (SCO) compounds and vibrational states entropy calculation

Spin crossover (SCO) compounds are molecular materials capable of maintaning  stability in two electronic states with different magnetic response, and whose stability can be achieved by applying external stimulus such as light, heat or pressure. This property makes them ideal candidates to be evaluated in new electronic and spintronic devices and, consequently, these materials have received a great deal of attention in recent years.

These materials possess different vibrational modes, each one owning its own relevancy magnitude within the molecule entropy. In order to quantify and verify each vibrational mode importance related to the molecule entropy, I used different python applications such as NUMPY and PANDAS.
